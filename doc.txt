install open cv
install tensorflow
download the darkflow repo to project directory from github link : https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow
 https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow
extract the zip folder to get the darkflow-master folder
navigate to the project directory and then navigate to darkflow-master folder via cmd
run command python setup.py build_ext --inplace or just pip install -e .
if an error occurs like install c++  extension or interpreter for visual studio code
then press ctrl+shift+x and search c++ and install interpreter or extension

you will notice a build file being created in the directory of darkflow-master
now we need to download weights or pre trained models or weights
follow the link and download the pretrained weights and model
https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

create a new folder named bin in our darkflow-master folder
copy and paste the downloaded weights here yolo v2 608 x 608 into the bin folder
installation is done

if you want to use yolov3 model and weights download yolov3.cfg and weights from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ or copy project from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg and paste the .cfg in darkflow-master/cfg and weights in bin

1st project: Processing a video file
add bounding boxes to a video file to generate labels and detect object via yolo
download a mp4 video file and move the file to dark-flow master folder for processing the image
navigate to the folder via cmd and use the following command in terminal
python flow --model cfg/yolo.cfg --load bin/yolov2.weights --demo videofile.mp4 --saveVideo

if you recieve any error for tensorflow.contrib library that means you have latest version of tensorflow installed you need to first uninstall the latest version and then install pip install tensorflow==1.13.2

or simply create a virtual environment by using command
conda create -n tensorflow1.13.2 python=3.6
activate tensorflow1.13.2

if the above does't work use the following to create virtual environment
python -m venv env source ./env/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow==1.13.2

or try using the following:
python -m pip install --user tensorflow==1.13.2
install pyx if any error occurs
The same problem occurred for me.

update setup tools by command pip install --upgrade setuptools or by python -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools

install visual c++ buildtools for your cython and python version by following https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other 

best way to do it is installing visual studio installer and check the c++ box

see on the web how to install visuall c++ compiler for python and cython


Second project: Processing static image in python
download a jpg image of an object example say dog
create a python file in your project directory here yolo custom object detection
here the file name is static_obj_detection.py

packages needed : open cv (install it) and import it
                  and import TFNet from darkflow.net.build

third project: processing and detecting or classifying objects in real time via web cam or a camera.
project name or file name is webcam1.py
go ahead and create a python file in darkflow-master directory

3rd project:
custom_object data collection, training and detection
data collection from online
webscrapping, annotation, xml or format conversion to yolo
at least 1000 images of each class to get good results

this project will be broken into 3 parts:
1) collect images of the object class (ideally more than 1000)
2) annotate the images
3) train and test

simple way to download bulk images from google search is install an extension for chrome named "download all images" from google webstore
extract the downloaded zip and save it in an images folder in the new_model_data directory
                  
next we can write a script to scan the images directory and go image by image to draw bounding boxes and genarate xml files that is annotation files and we are gonna create callbacks or functions to get mouseclicks for annotation and boundig boxes

or we can use labelimg library to label images and generate annotated files for our model
for using labelimg we would need pyqt5 for using the gui software

or we can write a script
here we will first try writing a script
create a draw_box.py file in new_model_data_folder
after that create annotation files and generate xml for each and every images by generate_xml.py

train your model by the following command given in readme file of the repository
https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow scroll down to trainingon your own dataset follow the commands

then make changes in your open cv code

follow code in cust_obj_detect.py
